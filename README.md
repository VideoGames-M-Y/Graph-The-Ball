The game is designed to teach and enrich knowledge about function graphs.
On the left side of the screen, a ball will appear, and the goal of the player is to move it to the end flag on the right side of the screen.
In the central part of the screen (but not always in the middle) the origin of the axes will appear, and in order to lead the ball from the starting point to the end point, the player will have to draw a two-dimensional graph using the algebraic writing of the function, which will appear on the screen. If the player succeeds in the tasks and finds the function that corresponds to drawing the path the ball must follow, he will win a point and move on to the next stage.
Since each stage has several ways to go, three coins will appear on the screen that the player must collect, that is, points that the function must pass through (the x and y values ​​of these points appear on the screen).

# HOW TO PLAY:
use your mind and linear knowledge and write a algebraic equation in the window on the top left of the screen to create a route from left to right (that will be the path for the ball to travel in the future).
